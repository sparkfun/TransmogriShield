[*SparkFun TransmogriShield (DEV-11469)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11469)

The Arduino Leonardo arrived on the scene to great applause. This was followed by the creeping realization that, because of the new microcontroller, all of our favorite SPI or I2C-based Arduino shields would be incompatible.
By using an arrangement of surface-mount headers to “intercept” the incoming pins and shift them around, the TransmogriShield takes the SPI and I2C lines from their new, less convenient, homes at the ICSP header and D2/3 pins, and moves them back into classic Arduino position: SPI on D11-13 and I2C on A4/A5.
